            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
            <p> Pharmacies are essential part of people day to day life, where they can collect any medication or tablets they are prescribed and receive medication to help them feel better from any illness. With all factors above considered, Hickey's Pharmacy has been designed in a very efficient way where any wheelchair can easily go around the shop with out any major hassle to pick up or buy any medical items.</p>

            <h2>Upon entering</h2>
            <p> Some pharmacys in both major cities and small towns can be victimised into having very cluttered and tight spaces, where it's a mircale in itself Manor Mill's Hickey Pharmacy looks visual appealing and welcoming for wheelchair user to come in and collect their medication or other medical or beauty products from the outside the entrance.</p>
            
            <p>Even if a wheelchair user doesn't feel like adventuring all the way into the back counter area, there is front checkout area (normally used for speific perfume or sexual health products) can easily be used for users to collect any prescribed medication.</p>

            <h2 class="foodleft">When starting to shop/collect:</h2>
            <p class="foodleft"> When entering the pharmacy, wheelchair users are properly welcomed to a wide enough amount of space to go from the entrance to the counter area without any hassle. One may think from, viewing these images that the cardboard School and sunglasses stand may be an issue, but in reality, most wheelchairs and trolleys can easily go through without any hassle. The fact that they're made of cardboard and light plastic helps workers to lightly move the stands if necessary.</p>

            <h2>Shelving of Products:</h2>
            <p>As seen in the other images above, Hickey's is really good at keeping their shelving levels to be very suitable for wheelchair users to reach for products without any stress or over-stretching.</p>
            
            <p>Even from going around the side areas of the pharmacy, a wheelchair user can easy get around any corner of the place with the place having an equal amount of width space all across the pharmacy.</p> 
            
            
            <p>By the time anyone wants to go to the counter, the counter is perfectly for wheelchair users to physically collect and purchase any medication. The staff are often very friendly, they would be willing to go over and offer any form of assistance towards all customers equally</p>

        <div class ="About-content">
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>Overall, Hickey's pharmacy is well proven to be universally designed for all customers with wheelchairs for having a very spacious and even mobile layout where anyone can go in without any major stress to worry about. The fact that they have a front reception area for wheelchair users who don't wish to go in further than the entrance is incredible for its adaptability, allowing more options for users who feel more cautiously aware of their surroundings. For many smaller pharmacy businesses in any location, I believe Hickey's pharmacy contains a strong layout that should be studied to make the store feel inclusive to everybody and benefit the community for people with wheelchair needs.</p>
