            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
            <p>Particulary when the weather is not a problem and if a wheelchair user prefers to not go by car, Manor Mills provides very well clear and easily accessbilile routes for pedestrian routes.</p>

            <h2 class="foodleft">Main Entrance:</h2>
            <p class="foodleft"> The main entrance you see in these images is where most pedestrains would enter and leave the shopping centre because of the road and traffic lights been in a close promxitiy. The path is well smooth and flatten wheel there are no dips or inclines that impact the wheels on the wheelchair.</p>
            
            <p class="foodleft"> The wide entrance doors open automatically with advanced sensors which provided plenty of room for wheelchairs and many other pedestrains going through both directions.</p>
            
            <p class="foodleft"> Although carpet may appear to be an issue for wheelchairs to easily get caught or drag it up by accident, the capert mad efrom very thin material to prevent any of these accidents from occuring</p>

        <div class="half-content">
            <h2>Side Entrance:</h2>
            <p>For the side entrance located from the sideway towards the mills, there is still plenty of space to go through and the cobblestones provide a smooth journey across without any tire damage. This area can be alot more quiter and has much more space compared to the main entrance where some wheelchair pedestrians can have a decent preference to enter the shopping centre this way to avoid any major crowds.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>Overall, Manor Mills treatment of wheelchair users who travel by pedestrian routes is vastly huge achievement in accessibility. This comes to huge surprise as the car park has proven to be a much poor condition in comparsion. In a way going into the shopping centre, can be a more perferable and comfortable route in and out of the shopping centre. </p>
