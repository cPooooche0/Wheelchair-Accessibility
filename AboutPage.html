        <h2>What is this website about?</h2>
        <p>This website is part of my final semester assignment to display my research investigating in a digitally accessible website for all users of various needs following the Universal Design principals. Our theme was to look into the accessibility and universal design of a local building. The building I have choosen to discuss and investigate is Manor Mills Shopping Centre in Maynooth County Kildare.</p>

            <h2>Why did I chose to use this place for my                    investigation? </h2>
            
            <p>I chose to talk about Manor Mills because of the fact it has been a huge part of my local town of Maynooth for many years, where it is a place where many people do their food shop, get books, buy clothes and go to the cafes to socialise.</p>
            
            <p>From having a family member who is a daily wheelchair user, I have witnessed first hand many changes to how the shops have treated wheelchair and other mobility users. Some changes have been hugely benefical towards their daily living, but there are still many issues that commonly occur which bring diffculties. For a town that is forever evolving with more housing, there is a need improve accessbility for even little things such as, accessing a lift or turning right in shops.</p>

        <h2>How did I gather my research?</h2>
        <p>I first looked up the definition of Universal Design on their offical website <a href="https://universaldesign.ie/">(https://universaldesign.ie/)</a> to help clarify what content I'm being graded for through the understanding of the 7 Universal Design principles all buildings must comply with.</p>

        <a href="UD.html">What is Universal Design?</a>
       
       <p>I would later stroll down to the shopping centre across a few weekends with my family member, to walk around the different places that hugely impact his experience when going down to do his shopping.</p>
       
       <p>I paid close attention to how much space he requires to get from A to B, how he manages to get around specific turns in narrow and open shops as well as being shown the quality of how the shopping centre treats their entrances and bathrooms for people with mobility issues including those with prams.</p>
