            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
            <p>All shopping centres contain plenty of clothing shops. At this stage almost every Irish shopping centre has a Carraig Donn store which sells really good quality clothing, homeware and jewellery products for Christmas, summer and Mother's Day gifts for all. For a shop brand having hundreds of stores across the country, ideally, one would expect the store would be easily accessible for all to go through without any hassle or obstacles. Unfortunatley, the Carraig Donn store in Maynooth, was showed to have a poor layout of the store for wheelchair users and this has proven to be a massive issue for wheelchair and mobility users. There was little to no space to turn a corner which can be very stressful for a wheelchair users especially in a shop that sells alot of fragile house items that can break very easily and are balanced on the edge of shelves.</p>

            <h2 class="foodleft">Upon Entering:</h2>
            <p class="foodleft"> Before entering the store, one can see how cluttered the floor space is with a marked lack of space to go through the store to the checkout area. With some boxes being very exposed and positioned nearly to the very edge of their shelves, it can make a wheelchair user feel very anixous to come in as they worry they might break something by accident and then have to pay for the broken item.</p>

        <div class="half-content">
            <h2>Expectation meets Reality:</h2>
            <p> When customers actually arrive in the store, it comes as almost no surprise how poorly the layout of the store is for wheelchair users especially when there is very little space to even walk around.</p>
            
            <p>One slight trip, with an individual falling down could cause hundreds of euro worth of delicate household items (such as china plates and cups) being broken and shattering pieces. Someone could easily trip over the stools as seen in these photos.</p> 
            
            <p>Even turning to smaller aisles and cornered areas there is still a lack of improvement, making it possible for a wheelchair user to turn safely at these awkward angles.  In some corners, they have partitian walls that reduce accessible space to go through with a wheelchair. In the image below, you can see a partitian wall separating the hand bags and clothing sections. This furrther reduced the aisle width and they could easily block the wheels and the wheelchair user's ability to move freely.</p>

            <h2 class="foodleft">A year round problem:</h2>
            <p class="foodleft">Even at the busiest shopping period of the year, Christmas shopping is still impossible for wheelchair users to look around for gifts without feeling cautious and claustrophobic with how poorly the shop has all their fancy and costly products that could have much significant meaning to the home.</p>
            
            <p class="foodleft">So if a non disabled person who has completed their food shop during the lead up to Christmas struggles to get around Carriag Donn to buy a gift with their trolley still in hand, a wheelchair user would find it merely impossible to get from the entrance to the checkout area.</p>
            
            <p class="foodleft">To make matters worse, the staff never provide any assistance when a wheelchair customer enters the store and needs more space in order to even enter the store ot manoever around the stock.</p>

            <h2>Potential solution:</h2>
            <p> With Dunnes Stores being in the same facility as Carraig Donn, they could easily take note of how Dunnes has an almost perfect layout on displaying fragile home products in an accesible manner. I think the way they have items tucked well away from the shelf's edge and have wider aisles and passageways for wheelchairs to go through is phenomenal and can significantly reduce the number of possible accidents which can occur.</p>

  <!---Conclusion-->  
    <div class="intro">
        <div class ="About-content">
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>Overall, Carraig Donn has a very poorly designed layout which creates countless difficulties for wheelchair users to access and go around the store to look at the household products. The mere fact that there is little to no space to go through and turn to a different aisle is appalling for a brand that has been around for decades and has hundreds of shops all across the country. Wheelchair users cannot go in without feeling anxious about potentially knocking over very fragile products worth a lot of money. A simple solution to this is by taking inspiration from Dunnes Stores' layout for homeware products, where customers have plenty of space to go around comfortably and all the products are well tucked into the shelves to prevent any possible accidents occuring. </p>
