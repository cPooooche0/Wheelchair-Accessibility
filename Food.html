            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
            <p>The car park is located below the entire shopping centre, where luckily the wheelchair parking spots are situated near the lifts to get up to the shops. The security and CCTV cameras are always active and have signs scattered across the facility to warn drivers who do not have a wheelchair permit to park in the wheelchair spots or face clamping and a fine to be released.</p>

        <div class="half-content">
            <h2>Upon entering</h2>
            <p> Most stores would have all the trolleys placed at the front so anyone who came in by car or foot can have easy access to the trolleys. For a wheelchair user who has arrived to enter Dunnes Stores in Manor Mills through the pedestrian entrance, they would have to go all the way down to the car park in the lift to get a wheelchair friendly trolley. The wheelchair trolley is usually abandoned a distance from the rest of the regular trolleys and can often be blocked by bigger regular trolleys. This can be difficult for many independent wheelchair users who cannot move the regular trolley due to limitations of steering their wheelchair simultaneously with manoevering the regular trolley.</p>
            
            <p>Overall Dunnes Stores is one of the major grocery stores in the Maynooth area to have brought in wheelchair friendly trolleys that are easy to attach to most conventional wheelchairs. Their competitors Tesco, Supervalu, Lidl and Aldi have only recently made this type of trolley available on a limited basis. The accessible trolley's backlegs simply clip on to the front bars of each of the wheelchairs and grip on prior to movement. Unfortunately, this particular type of trolley is not compatible with larger power wheelchairs.</p>

            <p class="foodleft"> When entering the store, wheelchairs can easily navigate through the clothes section given the amount of wide space leading to the food area. By the time a wheelchair user reaches the food hall entrance, they are welcomed with plenty of open space that allows plenty of room for customers to go in both directions with out any hassle or meeting other obstacles.</p>
            
            <p class="foodleft">Even to the right-hand side of the store, there is plenty of space which is easily accessible to make a cup of coffee and select a sandwich at the Cafe Sol take out area, and the counter is mounted at very low level so a wheelchair user can easily reach for napkins, cups and even pour milk very comfortably. </p>

            <h2>Easy Asscess to Products:</h2>
            <p> The shop has plenty of space for wheelchairs and all sorts of trolleys including child/infant trollies go by in both directions easily and without obstruction. Given the vast number of shelves filled with a variety of different products, the majority of food and drink products are accessible and easily grabbed from the shelves to be put in the shoppers trolley. This is hugely benefical for wheelchair users as it means they won't have to overstretch their bodies in order to reach for a particular product.</p>
            
            <p>Even if they're on their own, the staff are very lovely and willing to help any wheelchair user to help reach for products from the extremely higher or lower shelves.</p>

            <p class="foodleft">In the off-license area, there are very light swing doors that can be opened very easily  by pushing the wheelchair or trolley through the doors. They can even be opened to ensure the open door is in a static open position where it is easier for a wheelchair user to only have to open one door to get through to the off-license area. It is also notable that there are also plenty of alcoholic drinks that can reached very easily from wheelchair height without assistance. </p>

            <h2>Leaving the Shop</h2>
            <p> In these photos of a trolley filled with groceries, all of these bags comprise an average weekly shop for a family of 5. With the wheelchair trolley attached being much smaller in size compared to a regular sized trolley, this means some bags have to be placed at the back of the wheelchair. This can be very impractical for wheelchair users and the person pushing as there is less space for someone to push a wheelchair with the bags taking up a lot of space.  But it also helps balance the wheelchair to the trolley weight.</p>

  <!---Conclusion-->  
    <div class="intro">
        <div class ="About-content">
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>Overall, Dunnes Stores has a very well-designed layout which allows plenty of space for customers to go around to do their shopping and most of the products are displayed at very comfortable and appropriate height for wheelchair users to grab their preferrred products. The meer fact the shop has invested in wheelchair accessibile trolleys is a huge success in itself in pushing towards a more universally friendly experience for most wheelchair users supporting the Maynooth Access Group goals. Although the shop has successfully introduced this type of trolley, a lot of further actions are required to allow ease of access to these vital shopping aids, where these trolleys should be located alongside all the regular trolleys in front of the store, as well as in their current location in the carpark area. The fact that a wheelchair user must go all the way to the car park underneath everything is a serious issue, along with the size not being efficient for massive food shops, and the lack of quantity of these trolleys must also be taken into account to make shopping more accessible. </p>
