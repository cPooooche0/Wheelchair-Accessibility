            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
            <p>Many people who want to get to places much quicker take their car as a method of transport. It is required by law (as seen in nearly all places) the wheelchair parking spots must be located in the closest parking spots towards the entrance to an area. Manor Mills Shopping Centre does comply with these regulations, where wheelchair users don't have to move very far in order to get to the lift in the car park down below all the shops. In additon to locating wheelchair friendly trolleys allowing less hassle for additional assistance to push both the trolley and wheelchair, the shopping centre is in need of planning a cleared and better path/journey between leaving the shops to the car park.</p>

            <h2>Upon Entering</h2>
            <p>Once the car with a disabled badge holder enters the car park it is allowed access to park in the wheelchair parking spot, the driver and wheelchair user are reassured with the fact they don't have move very far towards the nearest lift.The close proximity to the lift is a huge achievement for allowing less distance and time needed to carry all the weekly food shop back to the car.</p>

            <h2 class="foodleft">Clamping risk:</h2>
            <p class="foodleft"> The shopping centre uses good CCTV to notice any unwanted cars parking in the wheelchair parking spots. Signs are placed all around the area to warn any cars not carrying the required legal disabled parking permit to move or they risk punishment including clamping and a high fee to release the clamp after a significant wait for the clampers to return to release the vehicle.</p>

            <h2>Wheelchair trolley area:</h2>
            <p>When arriving to the trolley area, a wheelchair user is met with the wheelchair trolley being blocked by a bigger and heavier regular sized trolley.This restricted access can be infuriating for understandable of reasons, particulary how all the wheelchair trolleys are only located down at the car park and if the wheelchair user is on their own, they have to navigate the movement of the regular trolley to access an accessible trolley.</p>
            
            <p>Once successfully having access to the trolley, they are once again met another challenge to dispose of dirty rubbish left abandoned on the trolley. With CCTV cameras and Dunnes Stores workers often moving trolleys back and forth to the car park, one would think they would ensure all trolleys would be left in a clean and well organised condition for all disabled users.</p>

        <div class="half-content">
            <h2 class="foodleft">When using the lift:</h2>
            <p class="foodleft"> Once entering the lift with a trolley attached, basically all the lift space is taken up by the length of the wheelchair and trolley, this means any assistance and another person can only fit in the tiny space left to the side of the wheelchair </p>
            
            <p class="foodleft">When leaving the shops to go back to the car, there is even less space behind the wheelchair. With the small size of the trolleys, more bags have to be placed behind the wheelchair. In some senarios, one may almost have to let a wheelchair user go in the lift alone with all the shopping while the other person runs down the escalator in order to meet them at the bottom of the lift area. This can be very dangerous especially if the wheelchair user is young child or has an intellectual disabiltity.</p>

        <div class ="About-content">
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>Overall, Manor Mills treatment of wheelchair users who travel by car is in need of major improvement. With Dunnes Stores being the only grocery place to have wheelchair friendly trolleys accessible, it is nearly a miracle that a person in a wheelchair with only one other personal assistant being able to fit inside the lift when coming in and out with all their purchased groceries to be brought to their car. If they follow along the lines of places that can allow almost 3 regular sized trolleys into a shop very comfortably, many wheelchair users would not have to feel claustrophic with the lack of space provided.</p>
        <p>Also if the shopping centre have already taken precautions regarding unpermited cars parked in the wheelchair spots, I think they have the full capability to ensure all wheelchair users have access to clean and easily accessable wheelchair trolleys.</p>
